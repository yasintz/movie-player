export default `1
00:00:01,442 --> 00:00:04,342
Oh, yes baby, I just
need one more second.

2
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:07,478
You know I've been waiting
on this for a long time.

3
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:10,647
And I know you're not
ready to go all the way yet,

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,250
but just sucking on
your boobs is fine with me.

5
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:16,785
Okay, open your eyes.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,754
Surprise!

7
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:20,722
You're not naked.

8
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:22,390
It's a promise ring.

9
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:25,993
Baby, it was
my grandfather's.

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,562
I'm going out of town for a
couple of days to visit my sister

11
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,664
and I want you to
wear this while we're apart.

12
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,566
- You're going out of town?
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,168
- What about the boobs?
- We're so young, baby.

14
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,903
There's plenty of time
for sex later.

15
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,173
Now help me carry
my bags outside, please.

16
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,713
I really wish I'd learned
how to play this thing

17
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:50,881
before I brought
it out to the quad.

18
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,459
Why'd you bring
that thing out here?

19
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:54,128
You hate guys that do that.

20
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,130
Well, right before
I left for school

21
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:57,900
my dad told me
I was ugly.

22
00:00:58,168 --> 00:01:00,636
He said, "girls only
like ugly guys,

23
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,638
if they're musicians
or athletes."

24
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:05,974
And mascots aren't athletes, so
I'd better learn an instrument.

25
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:07,642
That's horrible.

26
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,029
It's not bad.

27
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:13,428
Oh my God, Sammy.
Check out that girl.

28
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:16,626
Oh my gosh, she probably
heard me playing the guitar.

29
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:20,038
Ah, what the hell!
You can have her.

30
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:21,677
All right.

31
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,551
You want to see the right
way to pick up a girl?

32
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,226
- Check this out.
- Good luck.

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,996
Hey.

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,734
So I'm on
the football team.

35
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,340
And I was wondering if I could,
like, take you out...

36
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:34,177
She doesn't speak english,
wax job! Move along.

37
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:36,014
Then I'll teach her.

38
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:38,687
She's my half-sister
from Bosnia, idiot.

39
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,758
And she's off limits to
jockgobblers like you.

40
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:43,263
Oh, Bosnia!
Is that where you're from?

41
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:45,867
My dad was a war hero
in Bosnia. So what?

42
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,904
And he had an affair.
So what?

43
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,574
- Leave Alma alone.
- Alma?

44
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,076
- Alma!
- That's your name?

45
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,179
That's a beautiful name.

46
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,283
Why don't I take you out
Saturday after the game?

47
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:55,318
- Saturday!
- No!

48
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:56,621
Yes, Saturday.
Here...

49
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:58,891
- Just put your number in my phone.
- Alma, stop it!

50
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:01,094
- Thad!
- "Thad."

51
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,233
You're playing
a dangerous game, Moran.

52
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,235
You're awfully close.

53
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:10,540
- Saturday!
- Saturday, yeah.

54
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:13,578
See, Sammy,
that's how you...

55
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,414
Keep playing.

56
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:21,890
Holy shit, it worked.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000

58
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,639
Okay, this is why
we work so hard.

59
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,643
This is why we suffer
through two-a-days.

60
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,278
So that on game day,

61
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:07,081
we look across the field
at those pieces of shit.

62
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:09,150
And know they have fear
in their hearts.

63
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:12,987
Now I've got
a game ball here...

64
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:15,291
222 all-purpose yards,

65
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:17,059
three touchdowns.

66
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:18,895
Craig Shilo,
come on up here.

67
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,035
All right, hey hey!

68
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,038
We all worked hard
for this win.

69
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,208
Go out tonight
and have a good time.

70
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,545
But remember, we start
all over again tomorrow.

71
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,852
Shit, you're gonna be all over
"sportscenter" tonight.

72
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:40,621
Aw, no, man,
it was just one game.

73
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:43,724
We still got a long
season ahead of us.

74
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,295
You really think I'm gonna
be on "sportscenter"?

75
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,463
Yeah, of course, man.

76
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:49,965
Do you understand
what this means?

77
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,234
What the shit is that?

78
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:53,503
- It's a promise ring.
- Take it off.

79
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,672
Denise is out of town for the
weekend and she gave it to me.

80
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:57,608
Okay, you're embarrassing
yourself, Craig.

81
00:03:57,643 --> 00:04:00,412
- Please take that off.
- It was her grandfather's.

82
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:02,114
Okay, fine.

83
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:04,117
Well, you know what
this means then, don't you?

84
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,786
What?
What does it mean?

85
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,324
It means we need to throw
you a promise bachelor party.

86
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:11,527
Oh, hell no, man.
I gotta rest up.

87
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:15,031
Bullshit!
Hey, everybody!

88
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:16,866
Craig just got
promise engaged.

89
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:20,538
And we need to throw him a
promise bachelor party tonight!

90
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,085
- What's up, T?
- Good evening, Mr. Castle.

91
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,686
Excuse me.

92
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,354
'sup, Lotus?

93
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,455
Chrysler.

94
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,057
Lila.

95
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,825
Chardonnay.

96
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,660
Looking good, Sable.

97
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:48,762
Absinthe.

98
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:50,263
Tolerance.

99
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:52,933
'sup, Nutmeg? Oh, yeah,
give me one of those.

100
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:56,336
You're my fave, Trixie!

101
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,608
Grazie very much.

102
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:06,378
Three mojitos, por favor.

103
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,881
This is a bad idea.

104
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,349
I shouldn't be
doing this!

105
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:14,849
Yes, you should.

106
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,616
And I know you don't come
to strip clubs very much,

107
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,318
so I'm gonna let you in
on a couple of tips.

108
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,054
Rule #1:
No touchy!

109
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,522
Pretend like it's
a museum of boobs.

110
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,691
Yeah, a museum where you
can go down to the panties

111
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,359
for 30 bucks!

112
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,360
Hey, I'm gonna need to
borrow 30 bucks.

113
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,529
Oh, man,
no problem.

114
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,430
The less money I have
in my pocket,

115
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,365
the less trouble
I can get into.

116
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,800
Thanks, buddy.
I owe you one.

117
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,969
You know, dances for football
players are half price.

118
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:43,638
I don't know how
I let you talk me into this.

119
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:44,773
I don't know either,
but rule #2:

120
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,407
Don't ever
lend Sammy money.

121
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:48,609
I'm telling you,
it always ends bad.

122
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:52,312
Oh, there she is.

123
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:54,980
You invited your date to
a club full of naked girls?

124
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:58,150
Yes, 'cause rule #3 is
never date the strippers.

125
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:00,651
You don't take the paintings
from the museum.

126
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:02,920
Plus that girl is
Thad's sister,

127
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:05,255
which makes her so much
hotter than any stripper.

128
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:08,824
I'm gonna... I'm gonna be back.
You're lovely.

129
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:11,326
You're lovely.

130
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,494
Hey!

131
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:14,995
I'm glad you made it.

132
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,630
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah, Saturday.

133
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:18,332
Saturday, yeah.
Let's get you a drink.

134
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:19,967
Want a drink,
like vodka or something?

135
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,703
No! No way.
Get her out of here.

136
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,371
- Thad.
- Thad!

137
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:27,674
I'm glad you're here because,
you know, we needed a chaperone.

138
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:31,812
Alma, leave this place.
It's degrading toward women.

139
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:33,847
- "The greatest for women?"
- Degrading.

140
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,682
Yeah, the greatest!

141
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,517
- Yeah, the greatest. Yes.
- No!

142
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:41,021
We're leaving. And if you
so much as look at my sister,

143
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,289
you won't live
to regret it.

144
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:44,856
March.

145
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:46,224
No no no!

146
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,125
He'll kill you.

147
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:53,463
Thad, come on, man.
I was just talking...

148
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,264
Holy shit!

149
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,302
Tell your friend if he
touches one more waitress

150
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,803
or bartender
or bouncer,

151
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:03,471
I'll cut off his balls.

152
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:04,905
I don't know him.

153
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,907
Dude, holy shit!

154
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:09,642
These stripps let you
do anything you want.

155
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:10,576
What?

156
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,277
I got lockjaw...

157
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,612
Oh, that is...
That is disgusting.

158
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:17,514
- Oh my God!
- Let's go spend some money.

159
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:23,385
Oh my God!
Yeah, I love that.

160
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,565
Oh my God!

161
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,636
Is the sun rising
or setting?

162
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:35,805
Let's see.

163
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,907
It's A.M.

164
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,543
So it's rising.
That's a good sign.

165
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:42,878
Oh, shit!

166
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,515
Oh, shit,
where's my ring?

167
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,117
Oh, shit! Dude, I'm dead.
I lost my ring.

168
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,819
Did you trade it
for something?

169
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:52,553
- Shit.
- Trade it for something!

170
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:55,656
Hey! Hey, open up!
I left my ring in there!

171
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:58,993
Wait, this is the best thing
that could've happened to you.

172
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:00,794
You ditch the ring,
you ditch the girlfriend.

173
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,463
Open the door!
It's Craig Shilo!

174
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,131
Yeah, they're gonna
open it now.

175
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,167
What's that smell?

176
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,036
Perfume...

177
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,571
Stale cigarettes...

178
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:17,843
No way. No!

179
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,378
Craig, did you
finger a painting?

180
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:21,946
- No.
- I did.

181
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:24,415
You broke rule #1,
didn't you?

182
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,350
Okay, maybe I did.

183
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,685
Wait, this means the ring
could be...

184
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,086
No no.

185
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,957
I think your ring's
inside a stripper.

186
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:51,277
Let me ask you something.

187
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:53,680
- Are you a dog?
- No.

188
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,815
Then why you barking up
the wrong tree, bro?

189
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:58,750
You take my sister to
a strip club last night

190
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:01,019
and then have the balls to
show up the next day to practice

191
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:02,820
like you the man?

192
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,855
I'm in shock.

193
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,624
So what time does the strip
club open tonight?

194
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,392
6:00!

195
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,227
What if my ring's
not there, man?

196
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,796
Denise is coming back in tonight,
and if I don't have that ring...

197
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,697
I'm really scared.

198
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:19,033
It's gonna be fine. Look, we'll
go right after practice tonight.

199
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,235
No no, there's no more "we," all
right? You've helped out enough.

200
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:22,903
I'm doing this alone.

201
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:25,572
Craig, you're gonna go to a
strip club and ask strippers,

202
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:27,940
if they found your ring
inside their vaginas.

203
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,808
I wouldn't miss this
for the world, buddy.

204
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,445
Hey hey hey,
there she is.

205
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,846
God, she looks amazing.

206
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,881
Leave it alone, man.

207
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,549
- Why?
- She is not worth it.

208
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:40,351
What are you
talking about?

209
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,353
She's beautiful,
smart, sexy.

210
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:45,323
And the fact that she likes me is
eating Thad from the inside out.

211
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,892
I've never met a girl who's been
more worth it in my entire life.

212
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:49,627
Have fun.

213
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:54,064
I... I got a cramp.

214
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,302
Hey, Alma.

215
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:02,470
Alex, hello.

216
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:04,171
So...

217
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,373
I'm really sorry
about the other night.

218
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:09,141
What do you say I make it up to you
and I take you someplace night tonight?

219
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:11,410
- Strip club?
- You wanna go to the strip club?

220
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:12,911
Da, the strip club!

221
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:14,379
God, you're perfect.

222
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:16,280
Alma, no!

223
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,981
Dirty!

224
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:20,716
- Hello!
- "Hello!"

225
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:25,387
I can't believe you
brought that russian girl.

226
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:26,888
This is embarrassing
for me.

227
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:29,057
- She's bosnian.
- Strip club!

228
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:31,392
See? Plus we're only gonna
be here for a little bit,

229
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:33,094
so don't worry about it.

230
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,234
- Sammy?
- Alex, hey!

231
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,736
- You looking for Craig's ring?
- Sure are!

232
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,905
Me too.
Let's put it this way:

233
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,106
I have not found it yet.

234
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,941
Aw, come on!

235
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,810
Know what?
I changed my mind, man.

236
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,578
I'm just gonna tell
Denise the truth.

237
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:56,580
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Don't be stupid.

238
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,281
I got you covered.

239
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:06,621
- Are you serious?
- Let's get this started.

240
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,900
What the hell
are you doing?

241
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:21,602
Sorry.

242
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:26,706
He probably thought you
were somebody else.

243
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,580
Money!

244
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:36,747
You better believe it.

245
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,252
Go ahead,
ask her.

246
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:46,787
- Hi!
- Hi.

247
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:48,789
I was in here
the other night

248
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:50,824
and I lost my ring.

249
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:55,726
And I think maybe
I lost it...

250
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,297
Inside of you!

251
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:07,499
- He's very smooth.
- Have you tried the lost and found?

252
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:10,401
The lost and found!
Why didn't we think of that?

253
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:14,570
We did. I just thought it'd be
funnier to watch you ask around.

254
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,140
Awesome!

255
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,577
Well, here it is...
this week's lost and found.

256
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:23,480
Wait, you found
all of this this week?

257
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:25,382
It's been a light week,
believe me.

258
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,983
You wouldn't believe the things
we find up there.

259
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:30,319
- Like up in the V.I.P. Section?
- No, our pussies.

260
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,955
Wait, you found all of
this inside of you...

261
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,156
This week?

262
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,727
- Yeah. You want some advice?
- Sure.

263
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:40,096
Tell your girlfriend the truth.

264
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,130
I've seen a lot of
relationships over the years

265
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:44,732
ruined because guys feel
the need to lie

266
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,866
- about what goes on here.
- She's right.

267
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,400
No, she's not!

268
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,736
Can I ask you a question
about honesty?

269
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,905
Paris, is it? When people
ask you what you do for work,

270
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,374
what do you tell them?

271
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:56,742
I wait tables.

272
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:59,311
See? We all lie sometimes.
It's totally okay.

273
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,713
I can't go around lying about
this for the rest of my life.

274
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:03,048
Yeah, you can.

275
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:04,916
Just tell her
it was stolen.

276
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:07,085
I'm meeting her at
the airport in an hour.

277
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,020
I'm gonna tell her
the truth.

278
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,855
Wait, maybe you don't
have to.

279
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,891
Maybe there's a way to
make that lie a reality.

280
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:15,560
- What lie, man?
- What are you talking about?

281
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:18,730
I'm talking about the $30
Craig gave me last night

282
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:20,999
is the best money
he's ever spent,

283
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,767
because now
I owe him one!

284
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:24,368
- Oh my God. I'm taking this.
- Wait.

285
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:27,038
<i>Center stage,
give it up for Bosnia!</i>

286
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,873
Where's Alma?

287
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:47,590
So much for rule #3, huh?

288
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:49,224
Yeah.

289
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:54,061
I'm gonna go get Denise
from the airport.

290
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:56,096
Yeah, good luck
with that.

291
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,151
Okay, Sammy...

292
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,519
Let's make it look real.

293
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,286
Oh, hey, dad!

294
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:28,988
Still think
I'm ugly?

295
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:31,122
Why can't you just
say you're proud of me?

296
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:34,758
Well, maybe you need
a little bit of this!

297
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:42,598
I can't believe you're not
wearing your ring.

298
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:44,133
If my father wasn't wearing
his wedding ring,

299
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:47,068
my mother would beat his ass
with her bare hands.

300
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:49,970
In all fairness, baby, but it
wasn't really a wedding ring.

301
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,404
What do you mean
"wasn't"?

302
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:53,372
What are you hiding
from me, Craig?

303
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:56,107
- Did you sell that ring?
- No, I didn't sell it.

304
00:15:56,142 --> 00:15:58,811
And what
the hell is this?

305
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,051
Hey, walk away, walk away.
Just walk away.

306
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:09,919
- What? - Hey, Denise,
your hair looks great.

307
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:12,156
Craig, please stop.
Just turn around.

308
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,858
Don't... just don't,
please don't...

309
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:15,559
Don't go in...

310
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:16,594
Wanna help me
with my bags?

311
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:17,764
No.

312
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:28,406
Our dishes.

313
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,109
Where are my clothes?

314
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:34,212
- My tv? - I told you not
to lend Sammy money.

315
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:37,550
Oh my God!
What happened?

316
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,386
Did a burglar
do this?

317
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,055
I really hope they
didn't steal your ring.

318
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,389
Man, what's wrong with you?

319
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:44,823
Craig!

320
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,027
Did you crap on
the coffee table?

321
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,896
I had to sell it.
That's what burglars do.

322
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,298
They mess the place up;
they poop to leave their mark.

323
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:58,667
I really don't
think that's true.

324
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:01,736
Who's broken into
more places, me or you?

325
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,371
Point taken.

326
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:05,873
Is that your ring?

327
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:16,014
- What's up, T?
- Good evening, Mr. Castle.

328
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,216
- Have a good night.
- What's up, Lotus?

329
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:20,854
Chrysler.
Lila.

330
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,790
Chardonnay.

331
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,692
Looking good, Sable.

332
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,193
Absinthe.

333
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,128
Tolerance.

334
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:29,529
What's up, Nutmeg?

335
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:31,363
I'll take one of those.

336
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:34,066
You're my fave, Trixie.

337
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,635
Well well well,

338
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,703
who's the new girl?

339
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,705
Daddy likey.

340
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:44,107
Why don't you slide on over
here and gives poppy a boner?

341
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:47,977
Yeah.
Oh, that didn't take long.

342
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:50,412
What I mean by that is
I got a big boner

343
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,713
in my pant... Alma?

344
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:54,883
Thad?

345
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:58,253
Moran did this to you.
He's a dead man.

346
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,588
Thad.
No, Thad!

347
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,926
So let me get
this straight.

348
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,262
Uh, a burglar broke
into our apartment,

349
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,896
swallowed your
promise ring

350
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,765
and then pooped it out
onto our coffee table?

351
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,433
Yeah.

352
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:17,602
I guess so, baby.

353
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,370
- Must have been a hungry burglar.
- Yeah.

354
00:18:19,404 --> 00:18:23,039
Or a burglar who likes to
go down on the paintings.

355
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,274
- Paintings?
- He was just making a joke.

356
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,444
A really bad,
horrifying joke.

357
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,213
Craig, you're gonna pick up that ring right
now, you're gonna put it on your finger,

358
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:33,849
and it's never coming off again.
Do you understand me?

359
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:36,851
I'm sure they need this ring
for evidence.

360
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:39,386
No!
No, we don't.

361
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,859
- I'm so sorry.
- You're welcome.

362
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:34,759
Uh, sir? Sir,
you can't come in here.

363
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:36,793
Shut up!
I'm a football player.

364
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:40,929
Show yourself, Moran!

365
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,802
There it is, baby...
back on.

366
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,037
After some pretty
disgusting travels.

367
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,371
Now go wash your hands.
Yeah.

368
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,374
Okay. And then we're
all gonna sit down

369
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,942
and we're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

370
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:59,678
<i>Reports of a
disturbance in room 107.</i>

371
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:01,747
- We're on it!
- 107?

372
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:04,116
That's our room.
We've...

373
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,686
You don't mess with a man's
family, Moran. Suck it!

374
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:16,791
Copycatter!

375
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,627
He crapped on
the coffee table.

376
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,329
Burglars, man!
I told you!

377
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:24,331
This is...

378
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,868
It smells just like mine!

379
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
